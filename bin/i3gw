`i3gw` - A Ghost window wrapper for i3wm.
SYNOPSIS
--------
`i3gw` [`-v`|`-h`] *MARK*
DESCRIPTION
-----------
`i3-msg` has an undocumented function: *open*,
it creates empty containers, or as I call them: ghosts.
Since these empty containers doesn'"'"'t contain any windows
there is no instance/class/title to identify them, making
it difficult to control them. They do however have a `con_id` and
I found the easiest way to keep track of the ghosts is to
mark them. That is what this script does, it creates a ghost,
get its `con_id` and marks it.
OPTIONS
-------
`-v`
  Show version and exit.
`-h`
  Show help and exit.
EXAMPLES
--------
`i3gw casper`
this will create a ghost marked casper, you can perform any action
you can perform on a regular container.
``` text
i3-msg [con_mark=casper] move to workspace 2
i3-msg [con_mark=casper] split v
i3-msg [con_mark=casper] layout tabbed
i3-msg [con_mark=casper] kill
```
the last example (`kill`), destroys the container.
DEPENDENCIES
------------
